# RAMI aerial robots competitions

RAMI competition aims at addressing Inspection and Maintenance (I&M) tasks achieved by aerial and underwater robots, since they are involved in the most promising applications in this sector due to the risks and costs associated with works at height or underwater inspections performed by human operators.

Since underwater and aerial domains are very different, both domains are evaluated separately in two different tracks. RAMI competitions for aerial robots aim to test the skills of the proposed robotic solutions in tasks such as precise autonomous navigation and automatic defect detection with advanced AI algorithms, while operating in a GNSS-denied environment.
